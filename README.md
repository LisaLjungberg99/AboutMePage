# AboutMePage
Created this page with CodeSandbox!

This is a simple personal website created
using HTML and CSS. It serves as an “About
Me” page for me (Lisa), featuring a
portrait, navigation links, a contact
form, and contact details with social
media links.

In the future I plan on adding some cool integrations, such as ChatGTP API or a small database.
